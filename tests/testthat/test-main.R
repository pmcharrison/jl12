  # Seems there are mistakes in the original paper.
  ## Fig 2:
  # Here are the implied classifications in the paper:
  # 1: consonant according to all rules
  # 2-9: consonant by R1, dissonant by rule 2, consonant by R3
  # 10-15: consonant by R1, dissononant by R2, dissonant by R3
  # 16: medium by R1, dissonant by R2, consonant by R3
  # 17-18: medium by R1, dissonant by R2, consonant by R3 (?) same as previous category
  # 19: dissonant by all rules
  ## Here are some example problems with the paper's annotations:
  # chord 6 cannot be built from stacked thirds, whereas chord 7 can.
  # => chord 6 should be in a different category to chord 7
  # chord 11 can be bult by stacking thirds, whereas chord 10 can't
  # => chord 11 should come in a different category to chord 10
  # chord 16 is not in the same category as chords 17-18, yet they all
  # have the same properties:
  # - from minor scale (R1)
  # - neither contain a major triad (R2)
  # - each can be built from thirds
  ## Similar problems exist for the Figure 3.
  # Conclusion: the original paper doesn't provide useful
  # regression tests.
