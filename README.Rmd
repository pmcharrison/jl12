# jl12: Johnson-Laird's (2012) Tonal Dissonance Model

[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

The `jl12` R package implements Johnson-Laird's (2012) tonal dissonance model.

## Installation

Within R, you can install the current version of `jl12` from Github as follows:

``` r
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jl12")
```

## Usage

Higher scores correspond to greater dissonance. 
These scores correspond to each of the distinguishable categories
in the cultural component of Johnson-Laird et al.'s (2012) algorithm.

Major chord:

```{r}
library(jl12)
jl_tonal_dissonance(c(0, 4, 7))
```

Minor chord:

```{r}
jl_tonal_dissonance(c(0, 3, 7))
```

Cluster chord:

```{r}
jl_tonal_dissonance(c(0, 1, 2))
```

The model comprises several rules. 
It is possible to call these rules individually, for example:

```{r}
jl_rule_1(c(0, 3, 7))
jl_rule_2(c(0, 3, 7))
jl_rule_3(c(0, 3, 7))
```
